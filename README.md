# 3aaisha_Calligraphy

## Description
They say friends are the family you choose, the wine to life, the yin to yang, but what does friendship mean to you?
Friendship is building your best friend a website as a gift. This is what this project is all about.
3aaisha_Calligraphy is an artist who does Arabic Calligraphy as a hobby and also as part-time job. With a decent following, she needed to go a step further with her own website(that I made) The website highlights what she does including heena, how to contact her and so much more!
